To run the code...

IMPORTANT!!
Get an GOOGLE MAPS API KEY and send it as the googleMapsApiKey prop from the LoadScript component inside the Map component in the components map.
without it you will not be able to see the webpage.
You need as well to write on the third get request in the app.js file inside the cors-server folder (obs. NOT IN THE SRC FOLDER).

(You may already know this or you may have another way to do it, but in any case....)
- Install Nodejs latest version if you don't have it.
- open the terminal in VS code.
- The server files are in the cors-server folder. Open VS code and open the folder where you unzipped the files.
- To run the server go to the cors-server folder through the terminal and type the- node app -command.
- The webpage files are in the src folder. To open the webpage go to this folder and type the - node start - command in the terminal, while the server is running.
- and voila! it should be running.
