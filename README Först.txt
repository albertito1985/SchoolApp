There is no way to deploy a Node server in Webshare so the only way to see the webpage is by running it localy. I don't have much experience with this,
and the only way I can do it is in VS code. so here it goes

(You may already know this or you may have another way to do it, but in any case....)
- Install Nodejs latest version if you don't have it.
- open the terminal in VS code.
- The server files are in the cors-server folder. Open VS code and open the folder where you unzipped the files.
- To run the server go to the cors-server folder through the terminal and type the- node app -command.
- The webpage files are in the src folder. To open the webpage go to this folder and type the - node start - command in the terminal, while the server is running.
- and voila! it should be running.
